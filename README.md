# final-project
This project extends a cyber situational awareness system by integrating fuzzy logic into a Bayesian Network to model uncertainty. It accepts linguistic inputs, performs fuzzy inference, and updates risk metrics in real-time. The system supports both a web API and a command-line interface for adaptive cyber risk assessment.
